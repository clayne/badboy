The below is summary lifted from the [praw docs](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html).

To run the script you'll need to register it as a script with reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/). None of the information is important, you can use 'http://localhost:8080' as the 'redirect URL'. You'll need to plug in 4 important things, plus an agent name into the credentails file.

```
client_id: The client ID is the 14 character string listed just under “personal use script” for the desired developed application

client_secret: The client secret is the 27 character string listed adjacent to secret for the application.

password: The password for the Reddit account used to register the script application.

username: The username of the Reddit account used to register the script application.
```
